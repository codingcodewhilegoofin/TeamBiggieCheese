## What to do 

You should build an application that leverages the unique properties of Bitcoin SV:

### Big blocks â€“ high transaction volumes with low fees

### SPV callbacks

### Instant payment verification

You may use any code libraries as part of your project, but they should be clearly separated (in a different directory) to your original code.
