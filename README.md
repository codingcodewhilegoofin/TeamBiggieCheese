# TeamBiggieCheese

## What to do 

You should build an application that leverages the unique properties of Bitcoin SV:

### Big blocks – high transaction volumes with low fees

### SPV callbacks

### Instant payment verification

You may use any code libraries as part of your project, but they should be clearly separated (in a different directory) to your original code.

### THEME: PEER-TO-PEER APPLICATIONS

The theme of the 4th Bitcoin SV Hackathon is 'peer-to-peer applications' - not just payments, but any type of application that involves direct interaction between participants on the Bitcoin network. 

Hackathon entrants are tasked with leveraging the recently released *SPV Channels service* as part of their application to facilitate communication across the network, as well as interacting with the Bitcoin network directly via the *Merchant API (mAPI).* 

For desktop applications, the SPV Channels service offers a simple **REST** interface

### Remember too, that your entry can address a smaller part of a bigger problem. The code component is meant to be a proof of concept. Make your entry as functional as possible, but if you need to, mock-up parts of other process flows - It is acceptable to demonstrate how your solution and its core components work.

#### MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
-1 Code submission using a GitHub repository named after your team.

-2 There should be one single Git repository for your submission. If external resorces are required, an install/setup script should be included.

-3 All submission should include *Docker or Vagrant container(s)* that the solution runs on. 

-4 Supporting documentation (this may include photographs of whiteboards, diagrams, written notes, a short business case, or any other material you think relevant)

-5 A 5-minute (or less) video summarizing your entry – e.g. a screencast demonstration of your product and a short introduction to your team, vision, goals, and business proposition.

## OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
A working application and/or website.

especially if your own development has dependencies installed that you are not aware of. If these are undocumented in your submission materials, it may be difficult to get your application to build without background knowledge of you work or the tech stack you are using.

##  If you only have one image, then a Dockerfile in the repo or hosted publicly on Docker Hub is acceptable (with documentation on running the container). If you have multiple images, then a docker-compose in the repo is also acceptable. 

Docker will be helpful in specific cases where we need to run your code, so if your project entails the creation of a library, for example, then Docker is not necessary.
